1. Introduction 
---------------
SP^2B is a Performance Benchmark for the SPARQL query language.
The benchmark comprises both a data generator for generating
arbitrarily large, DBLP-like data sets, and a set of SPARQL
benchmark queries, which cover a variety of typical SPARQL
operator constellations and RDF access patterns.

SP^2B is a research project from Freiburg University and has
been laid out to provide a basis for comparing SPARQL optimization
approaches in a uniform benchmark scenario. Of course, it can also
be used to compare SPARQL engines against each other, detect
deficiencies in existing implementations, and to tune SPARQL
engines.


2. Getting Started
------------------
Depending on the type of archive you downloaded from the SP^2B
homepage, the following subdirectories might be available.

sp2b
 |
 |-- ./src       contains the source code of the data generator
 |-- ./bin       contains precompiled binaries of the data generator
 |-- ./queries   contains the benchmark queries

If you are just interested in applying the benchmark, you should
simply use the precompiled binary (we provide binaries for Linux and
Windows). You will find more detailed information on the individual
components in the README files in the respective directory.


3. License 
----------
The SP^2B data generator has been published under the Berkeley
License and is open source. Detailed licensing information can
be found in the attached COPYING file.
