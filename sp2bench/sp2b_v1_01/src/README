=================================


1. Compiling the Source Code 
----------------------------
We provide a Makefile for compiling the project. All you need is
a standard installation of build tools such as g++ and make.
We have tested compilation under Windows using MinGW and MSYS [1].

To compile from scratch, simply type 

> make

and wait for the executable sp2b_gen being build. When compiling
under Windows, you might rename the executable 'sp2b_gen' to
'sp2b_gen.exe' after compilation.


2. Running the Data Generator 
-----------------------------
For instructions on how to run the data generator and command line
options, see the README file at sp2b/bin/README. 


3. Compile Options
------------------
You should not use optimization level -O3, since it might change
the shape of the generated data (some floating point optimizations
in this optimization level are no longer semantics-preserving).


4. Documentation
----------------
A doxygen file (DOXYFILE) for generating the documentation is available
in subdirectory ./doc. You may use the doxygen tool [2] to generate the
documentation.


5. License 
----------
The SP^2B data generator has been published under the Berkeley
License and is open source. Detailed licensing information can
be found in the attached COPYING file.
